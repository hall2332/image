1
00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:04.423
all right everybody welcome back

3
00:00:04.423 --> 00:00:06.655
in today's lesson here we are going to

5
00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:08.879
be talking about how we approach a very

7
00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.108
important question when it comes to

9
00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:14.143
our patients are they fluid responders

11
00:00:14.143 --> 00:00:16.168
does our patient need fluids or do they

13
00:00:16.168 --> 00:00:17.179
need something else

15
00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.203
we find that about 50 of our patients

17
00:00:20.203 --> 00:00:21.214
respond to fluid

19
00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:23.238
while the other half just don't since

21
00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.258
there are some very serious consequences

23
00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:28.286
to using fluid and the critically ill

25
00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:30.309
there has to be some way to determine

27
00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.326
who is going to respond

29
00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:35.351
with better odds than just a coin flip

31
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:36.369
in this lesson here i'm going to dive

33
00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.387
into some of the strategies that we have

35
00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:42.427
to evaluate our patients fluid

37
00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:46.461
responsiveness

39
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:53.536
[Music]

41
00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:55.554
all right you guys and welcome back to

43
00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.579
another video lesson from icu advantage

45
00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.604
my name is eddie watson and my goal with

47
00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:02.622
this channel is to try to give you the

49
00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:04.644
confidence to succeed in the icu

51
00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:06.664
by taking these complex critical care

53
00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:08.681
subjects and making them easy to

55
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:08.688
understand

57
00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:10.704
i hope that i'm able to do just that for

59
00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:12.723
you guys and if i am i invite you to

to take the quiz on this lesson here and

81
00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:29.895
be entered into our weekly drawings for

83
00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:30.902
gift cards

85
00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:31.916
all right so with that out of the way

87
00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:34.941
the great question of whether or not our

89
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:35.955
patients need fluid

91
00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:37.974
is really one of the great challenges

93
00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:39.993
that has existed since the dawn of

95
00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:40.100
critical care management

97
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.103
fluids for patients who need them can be

99
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.105
a very important tool in helping to

101
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.107
optimize our patient

103
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.109
but for others can have very real

105
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.111
consequences that will not only work

107
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.113
against us but can also increase length

109
00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:54.114
of stay

111
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:57.117
and mortality and so for these reasons

113
00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.118
we need to have a way to try and

115
00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.119
determine

117
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.122
as best as we possibly can whether our

119
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.123
patient will actually need fluids

121
00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.125
or whether we need to try some other

123
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.127
approaches and the fact of the matter is

125
00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.130
that some just don't now in order to

127
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.132
better understand the why behind the use

129
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.133
of fluids

131
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.135
we really need to understand what we

133
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.137
hope to achieve by actually giving them

135
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:17.137
fluids

137
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.139
and so let's talk about that why do we

139
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.140
give fluids

141
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.143
so with our patients in the multitude of

143
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.144
different

145
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.146
icus and different physiological

147
00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.148
processes that they have going on

149
00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.150
there can really be a wide variety of

151
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.152
reasons that are contributing to the

153
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.154
need of fluids

155
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.155
our patients could be bleeding and

157
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.158
hypovolemic they could be dehydrated and

159
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.159
hypovalemic

161
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.161
they could be septic and having a

163
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.163
relative hypovolemia

165
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.166
very different processes but the same

167
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.167
end result

169
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.168
that the volume of blood returning to

171
00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:51.171
the heart aka our preload

173
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.173
is not enough to support an adequate

175
00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:55.174
cardiac output

177
00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.177
and thus an adequate perfusion and so in

179
00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.178
order to better understand

181
00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.180
why this is we need to bring up

183
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.182
everyone's favorite friend

185
00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.184
the frank starling law and really the

187
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.185
frank starling curve

189
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.187
now while i'm not going to go into

191
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.189
detail about it here you need to

193
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.190
understand the basics of what this all

195
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.192
means to your patient

197
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.194
and the essence of what they described

199
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.196
was that the length of the myocardial

201
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.197
tissue

203
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.199
is directly related to the force of the

205
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.201
subsequent contraction

207
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.203
the more we stretch the muscle fibers

209
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.204
the stronger they're going to contract

211
00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.207
and what stretches these fibers is what

213
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.209
we refer to as our preload

215
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.211
so when we look at the graph of the

217
00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:32.212
curve

219
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:36.215
we have preload on the bottom and stroke

221
00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:36.216
volume

223
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.218
on the left hand side and then here we

225
00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.221
have an example of a curve of

227
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.224
a normal patient the key takeaway here

229
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.226
is that on the left side of this curve

231
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.229
if we increase our preload we also see

233
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.229
an

235
00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.232
increase in their stroke volume these

237
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.233
are actually patients who we consider to

239
00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:54.234
be

241
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.236
preload dependent now as we move further

243
00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.237
to the right

245
00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:00.240
we begin to see the curve flatten and

247
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.242
increases in preload are really met with

249
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.244
less and less of an increase in stroke

251
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.246
volume until we either see

253
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.249
no change and then even some decrease if

255
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.250
we go further

257
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.252
these are the patients who are preload

259
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.253
independent

261
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.255
and what this all means is that our

263
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.257
patient who is preload dependent will

265
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.259
see a benefit to their stroke volume if

267
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.260
we give them fluid

269
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.262
and the patient who is preload

271
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.264
independent will not now

273
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.266
important to know too is that the shape

275
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.268
and position of the curve

277
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.270
will vary between individuals so here we

279
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.271
have an

281
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.274
example of a hyperdynamic patient

283
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.277
here would be a hypodynamic patient and

285
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.279
then down here would be an example of

287
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.281
someone in cardiogenic shock

289
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.283
as you can see depending on what's going

291
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.284
on with our patient and how their

293
00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:46.285
particular curve

295
00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.288
is we're going to find very different

297
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.289
responses to

299
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.291
various different amounts of preload and

301
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.293
or changes in that preload

303
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.295
now this is very simplistic but this is

305
00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:56.296
the core

307
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.298
of what we need to understand to try and

309
00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:01.300
determine if our patients need fluid or

311
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.301
not

313
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.303
if we will not see an increase in their

315
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.305
stroke volume thus their cardiac output

317
00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:08.307
we really shouldn't be giving them fluid

319
00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:09.309
so now that we understand what we're

321
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.311
trying to do with fluids we're left with

323
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.312
the age-old question

325
00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:15.315
how do we know if they need fluids how

327
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.315
do we know

329
00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.318
where on the frank starling curve they

331
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.318
reside

333
00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:21.321
and then remember that our patient does

335
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.323
not present at one point on the curve

337
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.324
and stay there

339
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.326
as things change with them so does the

341
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.328
dynamic of whether or not they're going

343
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.329
to respond to fluid

345
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.331
and so over time we've developed

347
00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:33.333
different assessments

349
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.335
and measures to try and determine our

351
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.337
patient's fluid responsiveness

353
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.338
and really the first of these that i

355
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.340
want to talk about are going to be our

357
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.341
clinical indications

359
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.343
at the heart of anything we do we need

361
00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.345
to always take in the information that

363
00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:47.347
is readily available to us

365
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.349
the most basic but sometimes

367
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.351
underestimated of these is going to be

369
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:51.351
that look

371
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:53.353
listen feel approach of our assessment

373
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.355
there is a lot of information that's at

375
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.357
our disposal here that can be indicators

377
00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.359
that our patient may need fluid

379
00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.361
the first of these indicators is going

381
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.362
to be our patient's heart rate

383
00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.365
now here an elevated heart rate may be a

385
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.366
sign of compensation

387
00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.368
in the presence of hypovolemia and

389
00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.370
decreased perfusion

391
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.372
with our patient's blood pressure a

393
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.374
decreasing blood pressure especially in

395
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.376
the presence of that elevated heart rate

397
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.378
can again be a sign that the

399
00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.379
compensation mechanism is

401
00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:21.381
not enough to really sustain the

403
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.383
perfusion we can also look at our

405
00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.385
patient's respiratory rate sustained

407
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.387
hypoperfusion can really lead to rising

409
00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.389
lactate and metabolic acidosis

411
00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.391
to which the body may increase the

413
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.393
respiratory rate to try and blow off co2

415
00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:36.396
and compensate for this acidosis

417
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.397
we can also keep an eye on our patient's

419
00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:40.399
urine output a decrease in the urine

421
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.401
output to less than one milligram per

423
00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:43.402
kilogram per hour

425
00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:44.404
may be a sign that your patient is in

427
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.406
need of fluids now we do also have some

429
00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:49.409
assessment findings that may also alert

431
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.411
us to the possibility of needing fluids

433
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.413
these would be things like decreased

435
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.415
capillary refill

437
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.418
weakened peripheral pulses cool clammy

439
00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.419
skin

441
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.421
and dry mucous membranes and then

443
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.423
finally we can look at some of our lab

445
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.424
findings like

447
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.426
elevated bun and creatinine

449
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.427
transaminitis

451
00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:10.430
elevated lactic acid and then

453
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.431
hemoconcentration with an elevated

455
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.432
hematocrit

457
00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.434
now while each of these alone may not

459
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.436
tell us if our patient needs fluid

461
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.437
you do want to look at the collection of

463
00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:19.439
information as a whole

465
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.440
as well as really considering what is

467
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.442
going on with our patient and this is

469
00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:25.444
going to help to guide our thinking of

471
00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:26.446
whether or not they would respond to

473
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.446
fluid

475
00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.449
and so this kind of leads into talking

477
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.451
about some of our static versus dynamic

479
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:33.452
measures

481
00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:35.454
so after taking in all the clinical

483
00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.456
indications we can also assess other

485
00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.458
information that may be at our disposal

487
00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:40.460
to try and determine

489
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.461
where they might be on that frank

491
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:44.463
starling curve when we talk about these

493
00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:45.464
other measures

495
00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:47.466
we can think of them as either being

497
00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:48.468
static or dynamic

499
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.470
now static measures are a single

501
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.472
perspective on what is going on

503
00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:56.475
one pressure one reading much of our

505
00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:57.477
clinical indications that i just talked

507
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.479
about are actually static measures

509
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.481
they only give us information at a

511
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.483
moment in time and are only looking at a

513
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.484
single factor

515
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.486
now our dynamic measures on the other

517
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.488
hand will look at the relationship

519
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.489
between two factors

521
00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:12.491
the heart and the lungs and this will

523
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.493
make much more sense in a minute as i

525
00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:15.494
talk about

527
00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.497
our different dynamic measurements so

529
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.498
the first of these measures that i want

531
00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:20.500
to talk about is actually going to be

533
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.502
our central venous pressure or

535
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.505
cvp so this which we obtain from either

537
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.507
a central line or a swan

539
00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:30.509
is still one of the most widely used

541
00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:31.511
indicators for preload and in fact

543
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.512
studies have found that a third of

545
00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:35.514
providers are using this measure

547
00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.516
and in many cases this may be one of our

549
00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:39.518
only indicator measures that we have

551
00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:40.519
available to us

553
00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.521
and the thought here is that cvp

555
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.523
directly relates to our patient's

557
00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:44.524
preload

559
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.526
and so what this should really tell us

561
00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.528
is that the lower the cvp

563
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.530
the more responsive someone should be to

565
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:51.531
fluid

567
00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.534
and the higher the less responsive so if

569
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.535
i drew that out on a graph here and we

571
00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:57.537
looked at our

573
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.539
cvp and our patient's fluid

575
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.540
responsiveness

577
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.543
as we begin increasing the cvp we should

579
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.544
see the patients become

581
00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:07.547
less responsive to fluid and in healthy

583
00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:09.549
individuals we actually find this to be

585
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.549
true

587
00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:11.551
the problem that we find is that when

589
00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:13.553
dealing with critically ill patients

591
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.554
when they looked at the data and really

593
00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.557
plotted the cvp and whether the patients

595
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.558
responded to fluid

597
00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.561
this is actually what we found cvp would

599
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.563
seem to have no real correlation with

601
00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:26.565
whether a patient is fluid responsive

603
00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:28.568
and so cvp is actually something that we

605
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.570
consider to be a static measure it does

607
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.572
not take into account other factors that

609
00:09:33.572 --> 00:09:35.574
can also be working either for

611
00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:37.576
or against our ability to stretch that

613
00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:38.578
myocardial tissue

615
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:42.581
for any given cvp it's simply a measure

617
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:42.581
of

619
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:44.584
pressure a moment in time and doesn't

621
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.585
take in these other

623
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.587
factors so for example an older

625
00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:49.588
gentleman

627
00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.590
who has a non-compliant stiff ventricle

629
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.592
may have a quote-unquote high

631
00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.595
cvp and be normal and still fluid

633
00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:57.596
responsive

635
00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:58.598
a younger person with a compliant

637
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.600
ventricle could have the same cvp

639
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.602
and be off on the fluid independent part

641
00:10:03.602 --> 00:10:04.603
of the curve

643
00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:06.605
the number itself doesn't tell us

645
00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:07.606
anything

647
00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:09.608
now from here we can talk about our

649
00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:11.610
pulmonary artery occlusive pressure or

651
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.612
pulmonary capillary reg pressure

653
00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:14.613
whatever you want to call it

655
00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:16.615
here we're using a swan to get the

657
00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:18.618
pressure inside of the pulmonary artery

659
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.621
and we use this as a surrogate for

661
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.623
left-sided preload now as you can

663
00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:25.625
probably figure out once again

665
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.627
we face some of the same challenges when

667
00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:30.629
we're using this static parameter

669
00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:31.631
and it doesn't take into account other

671
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.632
things that could impact what this

673
00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:34.633
pressure is

675
00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:36.636
and so just like with the cbp in these

677
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.637
critically ill

679
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.639
patients we tend to find that there's

681
00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:41.641
really no correlation

683
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.642
between this number and whether a

685
00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:45.644
patient is fluid responsive

687
00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:47.647
and so that leads me into talk about a

689
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:50.649
couple other measures that we have

691
00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:51.651
and these are ones that we actually

693
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.653
classify as dynamic measures

695
00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:56.655
and again for the dynamic measure we're

697
00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:58.657
looking at the relationship

699
00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:01.660
between the heart and the lungs so

701
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.662
what's happening here is that as the

703
00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:04.663
lungs expand

705
00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:06.666
they increase our intrathoracic pressure

707
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.668
this increase in intrathoracic pressure

709
00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:11.670
is going to reduce venous return to the

711
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.670
heart

713
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.673
decreasing our preload it also puts

715
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.675
pressure on the heart and decreases its

717
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.676
filling volume as well

719
00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:20.679
as a result with inflated lungs we see

721
00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.682
decreases in stroke volume now as the

723
00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.684
lungs deflate we see the intrathoracic

725
00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:26.686
pressure go down

727
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.688
increasing preload and then thus

729
00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:30.690
increasing stroke volume

731
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.692
and so this expansion deflation

733
00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:34.693
inspiration

735
00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:36.696
expiration leads to cyclical changes in

737
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.698
our patient stroke volume which we can

739
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.698
actually measure

741
00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:41.700
when a patient is fluid dependent we see

743
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.701
greater variation

745
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:44.703
and thus we find these dynamic measures

747
00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:46.706
to actually be better indicators of

749
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.707
fluid responsiveness

751
00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:49.709
and these two different measures are

753
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.710
something we refer to as

755
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.713
pulse pressure variation or ppv and

757
00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.715
stroke volume variation

759
00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:59.718
or svv now ppv and svv

761
00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:00.720
are just two different measures of

763
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.721
essentially the same thing

765
00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:04.723
and so let's start off talking about our

767
00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:05.725
pulse pressure variation

769
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.726
so here when we look at this pulse

771
00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:09.728
pressure this is going to be the

773
00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:10.729
difference from the

775
00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:13.732
end diastolic pressure to the peak

777
00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:14.733
systolic pressure

779
00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:16.736
and so here's an example of an arterial

781
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:17.736
tracing

783
00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:18.738
and you can definitely see that

785
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.739
variation in fact i'm sure you guys have

787
00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:22.741
probably seen this before on the monitor

789
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:24.743
and what we can do is we can actually

791
00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:26.746
measure these points in these values and

793
00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.747
we're going to compare the pulse

795
00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:30.749
pressure from the highest point that we

797
00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:31.751
see here which is going to be at the end

799
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.752
of expiration

801
00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.754
to the lowest point down here which is

803
00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:36.755
going to be the end of

805
00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:38.757
inspiration when we compare those two

807
00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.759
pulse pressures we can see the

809
00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:41.760
difference between them

811
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.762
if we find this difference to be greater

813
00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.764
than or equal to 13 percent

815
00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.766
this patient is going to be fluid

817
00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:48.767
responsive now when we look at our

819
00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:50.769
stroke volume variation

821
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:51.771
that this actually requires special

823
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.772
equipment something like the vigilaio

825
00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:56.775
or the flow track and it has to be able

827
00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:57.777
to calculate the area

829
00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.779
underneath the arterial tracing as you

831
00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:01.780
see here

833
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.782
up until the aortic valve closes at the

835
00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:04.784
aortic notch

837
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.785
now here then what we're going to do is

839
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.787
we're going to compare this volume

841
00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.789
again at the highest point end of

843
00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.791
expiration to the lowest point end of

845
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:13.792
inspiration

847
00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.794
and then see what kind of variance we

849
00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:18.797
have if it's greater than or equal to 13

851
00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:19.799
again once again these patients are

853
00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:21.801
going to be fluid responsive

855
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.803
now as i said these dynamic measures we

857
00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:25.804
actually

859
00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:27.806
found to be good indicators of fluid

861
00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:28.808
responsiveness in our patients

863
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.809
but unfortunately we do have some

865
00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:32.811
limitations with them they really only

867
00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.813
hold true as a measure of fluid

869
00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:36.816
responsiveness in certain situations

871
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.817
first our patients have to be

873
00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.819
mechanically ventilated on positive

875
00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:41.820
pressure ventilation

877
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.822
they also have to be synchronous with

879
00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:44.823
that ventilation we actually have to be

881
00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:46.825
giving them eight milliliters per

883
00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:47.827
kilogram for their volumes

885
00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:49.829
and they have to have moderate amount of

887
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.830
peeps so less than 10.

889
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.832
in addition to that they also have to

891
00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:55.834
have a regular rhythm they have to have

893
00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.836
normal intra-abdominal pressure as well

895
00:13:57.836 --> 00:13:59.838
as normal thoracic compliance

897
00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:01.840
if all of this isn't true then we really

899
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.842
can't rely on these measures

901
00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:05.844
to be good indicators of whether our

903
00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.846
patients are fluid responsive

905
00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.848
and so our patient who is awake and

907
00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:10.849
spontaneously breathing

909
00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:12.852
this is going to be of no value to us

911
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.854
now another possible way to get some

913
00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.856
measures is going to be with the use of

915
00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:18.857
bedside ultrasound

917
00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:20.859
now we've actually seen a growth in the

919
00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:21.860
use of bedside ultrasound to help

921
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.862
evaluate the critically ill patient

923
00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:24.863
and it's great because this is a

925
00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:26.866
non-invasive tool with a lower risk

927
00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.867
profile especially when comparing it

929
00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:30.869
against something like the insertion of

931
00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:30.870
a swan

933
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.871
and there's actually a lot that can be

935
00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:34.873
determined with ultrasound but when it

937
00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:36.875
comes to fluid responsiveness there are

939
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:38.877
a few main things that we're looking for

941
00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:40.879
now keep in mind this is going to be a

943
00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.881
very quick overview of these here

945
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.883
but one of the things that we look for

947
00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:46.885
is our ivc diameter and its

949
00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:47.886
collapsibility

951
00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:49.888
now this though is actually correlated

953
00:14:49.888 --> 00:14:51.890
with right atrial pressure or cvp

955
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.893
thus this is just another static measure

957
00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:55.895
we can also look at the ivc

959
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.896
distensibility index

961
00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.898
this is going to be a dynamic measure of

963
00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:01.900
the change in size of the ivc

965
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.903
with respirations on a mechanically

967
00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:05.904
intubated patient

969
00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.906
and so again we're going to see some of

971
00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:09.908
the same limitations that we see with

973
00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.910
our pulse pressure variation and our

975
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.912
stroke volume variation

977
00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.914
we can also look at our sub aortic pulse

979
00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:17.916
velocity and here we're comparing the

981
00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:18.917
velocity

983
00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:21.920
of variation of blood being ejected into

985
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.921
the aorta

987
00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.923
and once again this is another dynamic

989
00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:25.924
measure and still has those same

991
00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:27.926
limitations with our ppv or

993
00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:29.928
svv there's another test we can do which

995
00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:32.931
is the end expiratory occlusive test

997
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.933
and so here we're going to do an end

999
00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:35.935
expiratory pause maneuver and we're

1001
00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:37.936
going to check for variability

1003
00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:40.939
in the ivc diameter with respiration now

1005
00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.941
once again this is another dynamic

1007
00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:44.943
measure and has its limitations but

1009
00:15:44.943 --> 00:15:46.945
these limitations are actually less than

1011
00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:46.946
with

1013
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:50.949
our ppv or svv and we can use this with

1015
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.951
patients who are doing some spontaneous

1017
00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:53.952
breathing

1019
00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:54.953
with the ultrasound we can also

1021
00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:56.955
determine our patient's stroke volume

1023
00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:57.957
this is a calculation that uses the

1025
00:15:58.957 --> 00:15:59.958
velocity time integral

1027
00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.961
as well as the lvot size and this can be

1029
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:03.962
used to

1031
00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:05.964
evaluate as well as determine changes in

1033
00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:06.965
our patient's stroke volume

1035
00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:09.968
so again with the ultrasound like other

1037
00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:10.969
measures there are potential

1039
00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:13.972
issues in being able to truly determine

1041
00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:15.974
our patient's fluid volume status

1043
00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:16.975
and really we should treat this as once

1045
00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.977
again another quiver

1047
00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:20.979
in our tool kit for evaluating all the

1049
00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:22.981
information that we have on what's going

1051
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:23.982
on

1053
00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:24.983
all right so we've covered many

1055
00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:26.985
different measures of possible

1057
00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:28.987
indicators of fluid responsiveness both

1059
00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:30.989
from static to dynamic measures

1061
00:16:30.989 --> 00:16:33.992
now while the dynamic measures do offer

1063
00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:34.993
greater indication

1065
00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:37.996
of the true volume status of our patient

1067
00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:39.998
just like with static measures they do

1069
00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:40.999
have their limitations in some

1071
00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:43.100
situations now given the complexities

1073
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.100
and limitations it is important that we

1075
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.100
take all this information together

1077
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.100
in the context of what's going on with

1079
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.101
our patient and try and best determine

1081
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:53.101
what their fluid volume status is

1083
00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:56.101
this really isn't an exact science we

1085
00:16:56.101 --> 00:16:57.101
don't have any

1087
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:00.101
foolproof way to say 100 that this

1089
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:01.102
patient is going to be

1091
00:17:01.102 --> 00:17:03.102
fluid responsive and so that really

1093
00:17:03.102 --> 00:17:05.102
leads us to ask

1095
00:17:05.102 --> 00:17:07.102
is there even a way to truly dynamically

1097
00:17:07.102 --> 00:17:09.102
determine for any patient

1099
00:17:09.102 --> 00:17:11.103
especially the awake patient if they

1101
00:17:11.103 --> 00:17:12.103
would benefit from fluids

1103
00:17:12.103 --> 00:17:15.103
and so here enter our passive leg raise

1105
00:17:15.103 --> 00:17:16.103
or plr

1107
00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:19.103
so the beauty of the passive leg raise

1109
00:17:19.103 --> 00:17:20.103
is that this technique can work

1111
00:17:20.103 --> 00:17:23.104
on both our awake and our intubated

1113
00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:23.104
patients

1115
00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:25.104
and is really pretty simple to perform

1117
00:17:25.104 --> 00:17:27.104
so the way this works is we start with

1119
00:17:27.104 --> 00:17:29.104
the patient sitting up at 45 degrees

1121
00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:31.105
and we do need to have a way to measure

1123
00:17:31.105 --> 00:17:32.105
their stroke volume

1125
00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:35.105
or their cardiac output and so this can

1127
00:17:35.105 --> 00:17:37.105
be done with a swan or a pa cath

1129
00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:39.105
even something like a vigilaio or a flow

1131
00:17:39.105 --> 00:17:40.105
track if we want

1133
00:17:40.105 --> 00:17:42.106
a less invasive measure and we can also

1135
00:17:42.106 --> 00:17:44.106
use the bedside ultrasound like i talked

1137
00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:46.106
about for a non-evasive way to measure

1139
00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:47.106
the stroke volume

1141
00:17:47.106 --> 00:17:50.106
and so after we have that measure we are

1143
00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:51.107
going to lay the patient flat and then

1145
00:17:51.107 --> 00:17:52.107
we're going to

1147
00:17:52.107 --> 00:17:54.107
raise their legs to 45 degrees and so

1149
00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:55.107
what we're doing here

1151
00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:58.107
is we're redistributing the venous

1153
00:17:58.107 --> 00:18:00.107
return from the lower legs to the

1155
00:18:00.107 --> 00:18:01.108
central circulation

1157
00:18:01.108 --> 00:18:03.108
and this is effectively giving them a

1159
00:18:03.108 --> 00:18:05.108
transient fluid bolus without actually

1161
00:18:05.108 --> 00:18:07.108
giving them any fluid and this is the

1163
00:18:07.108 --> 00:18:08.108
equivalent to

1165
00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:11.109
around 500 ml of a fluid bolus we then

1167
00:18:11.109 --> 00:18:14.109
monitor their stroke volume and or their

1169
00:18:14.109 --> 00:18:14.109
cardiac

1171
00:18:14.109 --> 00:18:17.109
index it usually takes at least 30 to 90

1173
00:18:17.109 --> 00:18:19.109
seconds to see the maximum

1175
00:18:19.109 --> 00:18:21.110
effect and if we see an increase of at

1177
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.110
least 10 percent

1179
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.110
in their stroke volume or 15 in their

1181
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.110
cardiac index

1183
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.110
that this indicates a high probability

1185
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.111
that they will be fluid responsive

1187
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.111
now the fluid bolus that we're giving

1189
00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:34.111
them is actually temporary and

1191
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:36.111
as soon as we reposition them back to

1193
00:18:36.111 --> 00:18:38.111
normal this is going to go away

1195
00:18:38.111 --> 00:18:40.111
and what's really great about this is we

1197
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:42.112
can repeatedly use this technique

1199
00:18:42.112 --> 00:18:43.112
to continue to evaluate their

1201
00:18:43.112 --> 00:18:45.112
responsiveness and then finally there

1203
00:18:45.112 --> 00:18:47.112
are some patients that just may not be

1205
00:18:47.112 --> 00:18:49.112
able to do the passive leg raise

1207
00:18:49.112 --> 00:18:51.113
in cases with these patients we can also

1209
00:18:52.113 --> 00:18:53.113
do a small

1211
00:18:53.113 --> 00:18:55.113
fluid bolus typically anywhere from 100

1213
00:18:55.113 --> 00:18:57.113
to 250 ml

1215
00:18:57.113 --> 00:18:59.113
to serve as a fluid challenge so here

1217
00:18:59.113 --> 00:19:01.114
again we want to be able to measure

1219
00:19:01.114 --> 00:19:03.114
stroke volume or cardiac index take

1221
00:19:03.114 --> 00:19:05.114
record of that measurement before giving

1223
00:19:05.114 --> 00:19:06.114
the fluid

1225
00:19:06.114 --> 00:19:08.114
and then again after we give them the

1227
00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:10.114
bolus and it's infused here again if we

1229
00:19:10.114 --> 00:19:11.115
see the same 10

1231
00:19:11.115 --> 00:19:14.115
stroke volume or 15 cardiac index that

1233
00:19:14.115 --> 00:19:16.115
once again this is going to potentially

1235
00:19:16.115 --> 00:19:17.115
indicate that they

1237
00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:20.115
are a fluid responder so that's sort of

1239
00:19:20.115 --> 00:19:22.116
our approach and evaluation when it

1241
00:19:22.116 --> 00:19:24.116
comes to whether or not

1243
00:19:24.116 --> 00:19:26.116
our patient is going to be responsive to

1245
00:19:26.116 --> 00:19:27.116
giving them fluids or not

1247
00:19:27.116 --> 00:19:29.116
it's really important that we have some

1249
00:19:29.116 --> 00:19:30.116
way of determining

1251
00:19:30.116 --> 00:19:33.117
where our patient lies on this frank

1253
00:19:33.117 --> 00:19:34.117
starling curve

1255
00:19:34.117 --> 00:19:35.117
because we don't want to be giving them

1257
00:19:35.117 --> 00:19:37.117
fluids if we don't have to but we also

1259
00:19:37.117 --> 00:19:39.117
want to determine those patients who

1261
00:19:39.117 --> 00:19:40.117
would benefit from it

1263
00:19:40.117 --> 00:19:42.118
so i covered a lot of information here

1265
00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:44.118
but hopefully this helps to give you

1267
00:19:44.118 --> 00:19:46.118
guys a little bit better of an idea

1269
00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.118
of some of the measures and assessments

1271
00:19:48.118 --> 00:19:50.118
and tools that we have at our disposal

1273
00:19:50.118 --> 00:19:52.119
to try and determine who these patients

1275
00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:52.119
are

1277
00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:54.119
i hope that you guys were able to learn

1279
00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.119
something from this and that you guys
